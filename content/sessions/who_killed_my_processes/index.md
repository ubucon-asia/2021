All of sudden, one of your processes that should be alive was 'kill'ed by someone's Signal! Who did that? Let's trace the issue with Linux Kernel hacking.
In this session, I will talk about a real-life issue I met while working and attendees would learn about where to start if they want to trace signals through Kernel.

Attendees at least should know what the Signal is in Computer Science.
