I needed LAMP Stack for working with Wordpress.
I'm not a developer or software engineer. and I just had only one small laptop.
I couldn't use public cloud for security.
So, I fell in love with WSL2.
At first, I was a little hard to set. but, It was not so hard to drive.
Let me show you, how I started setting ubuntu with WSL2 For beginers.
