### About the speaker
I've been a interesting seeker since when I was a high school student, and a Linux desktop and open source was seems very fun in my sight. Then, I majored computer engineering at University, and I'm currently seeking a position for software engineer, and open source has been remained as one of my main concerns.
Since I got many diffficulty in to get entering to open source contribution, I wanted to communicate with open source newcomers to promote their contribution, and I'm handling some works for it. By doing so, I want to improve community communication in Korea, and finally I want to enjoy funny works with Korean open source contributers, and fully enjoy my favorite open source softwares.
