Desktop Ubuntu is a good use for workstations and some games development. I have tried for it not only software/hardware development but also game and daily use. Lately, we can use Chinese hackable PCs like GPD/Chuwi, which encourages 'hacking.' - Firmware/OSes. We could customize such PCs for our use.

I will talk and discuss about my practice to use Ubuntu Desktop on Raspberry Pi and such 'hackable' PCs.

 - How to treat SD cards.
 - How to hack UEFI to optimize PC
 - Games on Ubuntu Desktop
 - Ubuntu Desktop and Raspberry Pi 
 - and more
