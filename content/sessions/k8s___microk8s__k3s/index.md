### About the speaker
I have played around with Linux since 2004, from Web Designer to Web Administrator (For LAMP) with Ubuntu being my main choice. I settled on Ubuntu as my favourite Linux distro. I will Promote About Linux and Ubuntu Distro since 2009., Raspberry Pi since 2013, Container LXD at 2014, Open Stack at 2016, DevOps at 2018, Docker and Kubernetes at 2019.
