To patch just one system, the administrator must identify that a patch is available, download it, and then deploy it to the system. In an enterprise environment, there could be hundreds of servers to manage, so the job of patch management becomes an all-day responsibility with the added risk of reboot fails after installation. Instead of manual updates, administrators can free up time and organize patches using automation tools.

Using Ansible made patch management simpler than ever. Ansible provides solutions for Ubuntu patch management which helps admins ensure that all the Ubuntu machines on the network are up to date with critical/recent Ubuntu security patches that are released and there are no security vulnerabilities in the network. You can automate the complete process and ensure that all your systems and service required are up-to-date.
