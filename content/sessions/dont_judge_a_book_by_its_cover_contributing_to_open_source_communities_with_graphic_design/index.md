In this digital era, everyone uses multimedia in their daily life. Cell phones, social media, and the internet seem to be the new basic needs. Moreover, the pandemic has increased the intensity of gadget use due to limited mobility and physical activity. Like it or not, all activities turn to online activities.

This makes business people, event organizers, and content creators compete for attention by displaying visuals and attractive appearances for each of their content. The open source community is among those who should be scrambling for attention. Therefore, graphic design is becoming increasingly important and needed so that the open source community does not lose its support, and remains attractive to new contributors.

In this talk I will share about my experience starting my hobby of drawing, getting to know graphic design using open source software, how my design skills lead to contributions to the community, and my career.
