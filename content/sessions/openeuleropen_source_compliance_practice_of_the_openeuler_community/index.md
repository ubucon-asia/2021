openEuler通过社区合作，打造创新平台，构建支持多处理架构、统一和开放的操作系统，推动软硬件应用生态繁荣发展。
openEuler is an innovative platform nurtured by community collaboration. It aims to build a unified and open OS that supports multiple processor architectures, and to advance the hardware/software application ecosystem.
openEuler社区在开源合规方面还不是很成熟，但已经努力摸索出一条有自己特色的发展之路，希望借助UbuCon Asia 2021这个平台与更多的开源伙伴交流促进。
OpenEuler community is not very mature in terms of open source compliance, but it has worked hard to find a development path with its own characteristics, hoping to use the platform of UbuCon Asia 2021 to communicate with more open source partners.
我将对openEuler社区的开源合规实践作一个简单的分享。
I'm going to share the open source compliance practices of the openeuler community.
