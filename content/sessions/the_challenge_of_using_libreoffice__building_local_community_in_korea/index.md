In South Korea, Both HWPML(file format: hwp) and ODF are a Document format standard as a public sector. The Republic of Korea government adopted OpenDocument as a part of Korean Industrial Standards KS X ISO/IEC 26300 in 2007.However, In South Korea's academic field, the public &amp; private sector, It is still using HWP as a document standard. They are still made and distributed in .hwp format. I'm a Full-time worker(Developer) &amp; University student in Korea. This year, I transferred to Korea National Open University, major in Chinese Language &amp; Literature &amp; University student in Korea. As a university student, I talk about the inconvenience of using ODF when making documents in Korea. Also, I introduce the activities of the LibreOffice community since 2020 in Korea. Last year(2020) and this year(2021) activities, such as participating in NIPA(The National IT Industry Promotion Agency - IT industry promotion organization operated by the Republic of Korea Government)'s open source activity hold programs, supporting  Korea-Japan LibreOffice conference by NIPA, and LibreOffice Local Community's activities (such as Hacktoberfest activities).

As a Korea LibreOffice Community Leader, I'll introduce my LibreOffice Community activities &amp; advocating LibreOffice to Korea Government's agency NIPA since 2020.
