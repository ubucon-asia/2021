A year ago, I was still actively working as a general manager in a tour & travel company. At the beginning of the pandemic, my company minimized activity and created new services to survive the pandemic. However, at the end of the day, we have to face the reality: we have to shut down the company because our company relies on mobility and physical activity which currently has to be limited.

No company activities means no job, no income. This pandemic has forced me to learn new things in order to survive. Unexpectedly, it turned out that open-source software really helped me survive this pandemic situation!

In this presentation, I'll tell you how I used open-source software to survive, use what I've learned to profit, and discuss what opportunities could be taken in the future.
