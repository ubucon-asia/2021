I'll be showing how to set up a build environment for UnityX. I’ll then fix some bugs in it and compile it live. I’ll also demonstrate how to do a Merge Request on GitLab and package it using qckdeb. I'll then be building an Ubuntu Remix live with the Ubuntu Remixes project.
### About the speaker
I'm an official Ubuntu Member and the creator and project lead of Ubuntu Unity and Ubuntu Web Remix.
