I'll first be showing how to set up a build environment for UnityX. I'll also demonstrate how to do a Merge Request on GitLab and package UnityX using qckdeb. We recently released our ISO builder for anyone to use it for creating Ubuntu remix ISOs. I'll be demonstrating how easy it is to use the builder by creating an Ubuntu Remix live using UnityX.
