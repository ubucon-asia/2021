DESCRIPTION:<p>Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo is a community of Linux users based in Surabaya. This community was formed in 1995 by a group of information technology activists in Surabaya. Because of concern for open source software products in Surabaya. In its development, many ups and downs occurred in the community camp as well as on the way to introducing the city of Surabaya to information and communication technology in the field of open-source software. Many conferences have been passed by Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo. As organizers, committees, partner communities, and as participants. Among them is the openSUSE Asia Summit2019 as a community partner, committee, as well as a speaker. In addition, the LibreOfficeConference was held in Taipei in 2019. Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo is an OSS community that already has a network and reach in Indonesia and the world. In Ubuntu Conference Asia 2021,the Community will be present as Community Partners and will share their experiences of ups and downs in managing this large community and the achievements that have been achieved.</p>
<p>KLAS&rsquo;s Buaya repository server was founded in 2007. At that time Buaya was still serving Ubuntu only and was supported by Radnet Digital Indonesia. Since then, this server has continued to grow. From the beginning which could only serve Ubuntu, there are 5 Linux distributions that we can accommodate now. The journey to where it is today has not been easy over the last 14 years. The server had been dead for 2 years, from 2016 to 2018, which in the end we got sponsors to revive it so that it can continue to help spread packages that are more affordable to Linux users throughout Indonesia. Our goal of introducing Buaya is to introduce Buaya to Linux users, especially Ubuntu users in Asia and Indonesia, that we have a free repository server that can be used by anyone and anywhere.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>To patch just one system, the administrator must identify that a patch is available, download it, and then deploy it to the system. In an enterprise environment, there could be hundreds of servers to manage, so the job of patch management becomes an all-day responsibility with the added risk of reboot fails after installation. Instead of manual updates, administrators can free up time and organize patches using automation tools.</p>
<p>Using Ansible made patch management simpler than ever. Ansible provides solutions for Ubuntu patch management which helps admins ensure that all the Ubuntu machines on the network are up to date with critical/recent Ubuntu security patches that are released and there are no security vulnerabilities in the network. You can automate the complete process and ensure that all your systems and service required are up-to-date.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Whether it&rsquo;s online or offline event, There&rsquo;s always boring and repetitive jobs for event organizers and volunteers. Putting cover on session videos and making subtitle for videos are part of them.
UbuCon Asia team, is no exception. But like you and other ordinary people, our organizers also have their own job and busy with that usually. As it&rsquo;s first event we don&rsquo;t even know if we can gather enough volunteers or gain sponsorship to hire some workers.
So, We decided to use some automation tools like CI/CD, Speech to text, Translation API, Video cover rendering template and so on to automate these boring job as much as possible and reduce cost at the same time.
In this session, I would like to share how we did this and what we&rsquo;ve learned while trying to automate stuffs.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>In this digital era, everyone uses multimedia in their daily life. Cell phones, social media, and the internet seem to be the new basic needs. Moreover, the pandemic has increased the intensity of gadget use due to limited mobility and physical activity. Like it or not, all activities turn to online activities.</p>
<p>This makes business people, event organizers, and content creators compete for attention by displaying visuals and attractive appearances for each of their content. The open source community is among those who should be scrambling for attention. Therefore, graphic design is becoming increasingly important and needed so that the open source community does not lose its support, and remains attractive to new contributors.</p>
<p>In this talk I will share about my experience starting my hobby of drawing, getting to know graphic design using open source software, how my design skills lead to contributions to the community, and my career.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Snap in openSUSE MicroOS Desktop</p>
<p>According to openSUSE wiki, openSUSE MicroOS is an operating system you don&rsquo;t have to worry about. It&rsquo;s designed for but not limited to container hosts and edge devices. openSUSE MicroOS Desktop is a MicroOS with a desktop-focused variant of MicroOS based on Tumbleweed. MicroOS Desktop is an immutable, rolling base as based on Tumbleweed.</p>
<p>Snaps are app packages for desktop, cloud, and IoT that are easy to install, secure, cross-platform, and dependency-free, developed by Canonical.</p>
<p>Snaps are mainly used with Ubuntu, but it is possible to install them as well in openSUSE MicroOS Desktop. There is a snap store, people can install apps (not only open source but also proprietary).</p>
<p>Using snap in openSUSE MicroOS Desktop may be a little bit tricky since it&rsquo;s still in Beta right now. This talk will cover Snap in openSUSE MicroOS Desktop from the user perspective, including the experience, how to set up, handling errors, pros, cons, and others.</p>

At the beginning of the pandemic, my company minimized activity and created new services to survive the pandemic. However, at the end of the day, we have to face the reality: we have to shut down the company because our company relies on mobility and physical activity which currently has to be limited.</p>
<p>No company activities means no job, no income. This pandemic has forced me to learn new things in order to survive. Unexpectedly, it turned out that open-source software really helped me survive this pandemic situation!</p>
<p>In this presentation, I&rsquo;ll tell you how I used open-source software to survive, use what I&rsquo;ve learned to profit, and discuss what opportunities could be taken in the future.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Bash is considered a difficult language for some people to learn. In general, bash language itself is used by people who work in the field of servers. People who work in the server field will be very helpful with the bash language because bash can run many commands on the server or can run commands automatically. For example, bash language is used in Ubuntu Server. In addition to the bash language server, it can be used in making programs, namely &ldquo;Sinau Bash&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The “Sinau Bash” program that I have created is intended for other people to easily learn bash commands. By answering questions from each level. Starting from easy level, medium level, and difficulty level. In addition, the bash language can also be used in the field of education, namely introducing students to the bash command with the &ldquo;Sinau Bash&rdquo; program.</p>
