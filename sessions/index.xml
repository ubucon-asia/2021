      <title>Ubuntu OS &amp; Service patch management using Ansible 
</title>
      <link>https://2021.ubucon.asia/sessions/ubuntu_os__service_patch_management_using_ansible/</link>

      <guid>https://2021.ubucon.asia/sessions/ubuntu_os__service_patch_management_using_ansible/</guid>
      <description>To patch just one system, the administrator must identify that a patch is available, download it, and then deploy it to the system. In an enterprise environment, there could be hundreds of servers to manage, so the job of patch management becomes an all-day responsibility with the added risk of reboot fails after installation. Instead of manual updates, administrators can free up time and organize patches using automation tools.
Using Ansible made patch management simpler than ever.</description>

      <description>A year ago, I was still actively working as a general manager in a tour &amp;amp; travel company. At the beginning of the pandemic, my company minimized activity and created new services to survive the pandemic. However, at the end of the day, we have to face the reality: we have to shut down the company because our company relies on mobility and physical activity which currently has to be limited.</description>

      <description>All of sudden, one of your processes that should be alive was &amp;lsquo;kill&amp;rsquo;ed by someone&amp;rsquo;s Signal! Who did that? Let&amp;rsquo;s trace the issue with Linux Kernel hacking. In this session, I will talk about a real-life issue I met while working and attendees would learn about where to start if they want to trace signals through Kernel.
Attendees at least should know what the Signal is in Computer Science.

      <description>Desktop Ubuntu is a good use for workstations and some games development. I have tried for it not only software/hardware development but also game and daily use. Lately, we can use Chinese hackable PCs like GPD/Chuwi, which encourages &amp;lsquo;hacking.&amp;rsquo; - Firmware/OSes. We could customize such PCs for our use.
I will talk and discuss about my practice to use Ubuntu Desktop on Raspberry Pi and such &amp;lsquo;hackable&amp;rsquo; PCs.

      <description>Bash is considered a difficult language for some people to learn. In general, bash language itself is used by people who work in the field of servers. People who work in the server field will be very helpful with the bash language because bash can run many commands on the server or can run commands automatically. For example, bash language is used in Ubuntu Server. In addition to the bash language server, it can be used in making programs, namely &amp;ldquo;Sinau Bash&amp;rdquo;.</description>
